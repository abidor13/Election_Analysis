## Instructions

#### Grocery Store List

## Instructions

# Create a Python list to store the following items as a list of strings. You need to buy:
 #   * Milk
 # * Bread
 #  * Eggs
 # * Peanut Butter
 #* Jelly

# Print out the list

# Wait! Your cousin is visiting next week, and they’re only allergic to peanuts! Change “peanut butter” in the list to “almond butter”.

# You just remembered that you have homemade jam that your neighbor made for you. Remove “jelly” from the list.
    
# You just used up the last of your coffee. Add “coffee” to your grocery list.
    
# Print out the updated list.
#from asyncio.constants import ACCEPT_RETRY_DELAY
